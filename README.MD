# Triangle graph generator

This was an application that I quickly made to test with a project for a friend.

It tries to make a graph from a triangle with paths going from the corners to a node in the middle of the triangle.
the new graph should be a hamiltonian cycle without new edges that cross the old. You're allowed to make a new edges, and reuse old ones. but you're not allowed to make new edges.
